            <p>The picture you see is a picture of a traditonal Fijian Warrior. The Fijian word for warrior is Bati. You may have seen this word from the fiji rugby team The Bati. That is where they got their name.</p>
            <p>Fijian warriors were the protecters of their tribe and their village. They were a very violent and ferocious group of people. Each of the things they wear on their body signifies their rankings and status. There was many different types of warriors, including valley and mountain warriors.</p>
