            What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.
        </h3>
            <p>
                Block tags take up the full width and always start on a new line, stacking vertically. Inline tags only take up as much space as needed and flow within the same line. Block elements handle larger structures, while inline tags manage smaller content like text or images.
            </p>
        <h3>
            What is the margin, border, and padding?
        </h3>
            <p>
                Margin is the space outside an element's border, separating it from other elements. The border is the line around an element, positioned between the margin and padding. Padding is the space between the element's content and its border, creating inner spacing.
            </p>
        <h3>
            What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?
        </h3>       
            <p>
                CSS units of measurement include absolute units like pixels, points, centimeters, millimeters, and inches, as well as relative units like percentages, ems, rems, viewport width, viewport height, vmin, and vmax.
            </p> 
        <h3>
            When would you use a figure tag?
        </h3>
            <p>
                You would use a figure tag to encapsulate content that illustrates or enhances the main content, such as images, diagrams, charts, or illustrations, along with an optional caption using the figcaption tag. This helps to semantically group the media with its description, improving accessibility and SEO.
