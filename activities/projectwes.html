            One of my main hobbies and interest is polynesian dancing, but more specifically Fijian dancing. I am half fijian from my moms side, and I grew up doing lots of fijian dancing. I currently work at the PCC in the Fiji village as a performer for our shows throughout the day. It is a huge part of my life as it conncects me to that part of my culture.

            Another one of my main interest or hobbies is bodyboarding. I love bodyboarding and I have been doing it almost my whole life as I grew up in Honolulu. My favorite beach to bodyboard at right now is pounders, and when I have a car ride down, I love to go to Sandys Beach.

        <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
        <h3>Albert Einstein</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."
