        I would consider Maui the demigod to be my hero. He has such an inspirational story. And I am not talking about the one from Moana. I am talking about the real traditonal legend of Maui. He was a very fierce warrior and protector. Those attributes are what I strive to fulfill today. Obviouyslt nowadays being a warrior doesnt really make sense unless you consider the millitary. But I am talking about being a warrior metaphorically. Maui demonstrates traits of that and is the reason I consider him my hero.
